## Features
- cfn templates in yml or json
- build for human interaction and automation (run 'cf sync stacks.yml' triggered by a git push if you dare ;-)
- a source of truth defining cloudformation stacks with their template and parameters
- cross referencing parameters between stacks (use a stack output as parameter for another stack)
- automatic stack dependency resolution including circular dependency detection
- helper features easing the use of cfn functions like Fn::Join, Ref or Fn::GetAtt
- easy user-data definition for https://github.com/zalando-stups/taupage
- allow stack parameter values updates in command line interface 
- encrypt/decrypt values with AWS KMS (https://aws.amazon.com/de/kms/)

    Usage: cf [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
    
      This tool manages AWS CloudFormation templates and stacks by providing an
      application scope and useful tooling.
    
    Options:
      --version  Show the version and exit.
      --help     Show this message and exit.
    
    Commands:
      convert            Convert JSON to YAML or vice versa
      decrypt            Decrypt a given ciphertext with AWS Key
      delete             Delete all stacks in a stack configuration
      encrypt            Encrypt a given string with AWS Key
      render_template    Render template as it would be used to create or update a stack
      sync               Sync AWS resources with stack configuration file
      validate_template  Validate template with CloudFormation API

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Stacks Config
Create a YAML file containing a region and some stacks in a stacks.yml file f.e.:

    region: eu-west-1
    stacks:
        test-vpc:
            template-url: vpc.yml
        test-stack:
            template-url: app.yml
            parameters:
                vpcID: "|ref|test-vpc.id"

### 2. Write your CloudFormation templates
Write your templates and configure them in your stacks.yml

### 3. Sync it
A simple command synchronizes your definition with reality!

    cf sync myapp-test.yml

#### 3.1 Update Stack with CLI Parameter
To update parameters of a stack without having to modify the templates, simply use the `--parameter` or `-p` flag.

    cf sync --parameter "test-stack.vpcID=vpc-123" --parameter "test-stack.subnetID=subnet-234" myapp-test.yml

## Config Reference

See the wiki to see what you can do in a stack configuration: [StackConfig Reference](https://github.com/cfn-sphere/cfn-sphere/wiki/StackConfig-Reference)

## Template Reference

Cfn-Sphere supports native cloudformation templates written in JSON or YAML, located in local filesystem or s3. There are some improvements like simplified intrinsic functions one can use. See the reference for details: [Template Reference](https://github.com/cfn-sphere/cfn-sphere/wiki/Template-Reference)
